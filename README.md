## Notice

## What is Kekki?

Kekkai is a library mod written in Java for 1.12.2 Touhou Danmaku Developer. DanmakuCore was built in Scala, and it is currently difficult to build and publish a version.

Kekkai embeds the DanmakuCore and Mirror, and offers some API to conveniently use the DanmakuCore staff. Additionally, Kekkai patches the DanmakuCore and expands its functionality.
